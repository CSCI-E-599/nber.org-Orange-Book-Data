# nber.org-Orange-Book-Data
This is a csv copy of all clean data files from nber.org.  https://www.nber.org/research/data/orange-book-patent-and-exclusivity-data-1985-2016.  Professor Heidi Williams cleaned all data from 1986 to 2016.  We should credit his work, if we use this data.  

These files give more Orange Book data than we can get from https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-approvals-and-databases/orange-book-data-files.  There is some overlap of data, so we might want to keep everything that is in the fda.gov Orange Book files, and add to it with entries from nber.org.
